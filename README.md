# Intro to React + Redux

## Setup

### Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sara-gudeman/gdi-react-redux.git
```

If you would like to save your work on your own GitHub repo, fork it first, then clone the fork.

### Set up your environment
This workshop was created using npm 5.1.0 and node v8.1.2. Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) to install and manage different node versions.

Check what versions of node + npm you are running:
```sh
npm -v
node -v
```

If you are not running npm 5.1.0 and node v8.1.2, install node v8.1.2:
```sh
nvm install v8.1.2
```

Make sure you use the new version:
```sh
nvm use 8.1.2
```

Verify you are running the correct versions.

### Starting the repo:
Run:
```sh
npm install
```

After that has completed, run:
```sh
npm start
```

Once Webpack has finished building, go to [http://localhost:9000/](http://localhost:9000/).
You should see a page with the text 'Hello GDInsta!'
